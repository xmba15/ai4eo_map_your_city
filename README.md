# üìù [AI4EO Map Your City Challenge 2024](https://platform.ai4eo.eu/map-your-city/data)

## Challenge Summary

Participants of this challenge are asked to develop a multi-modal model to estimate the construction year of any given building from 3 modality inputs: street-view imagery, VHR resolution top-view imagery, Medium Resolution S2 imagery. For half of the test set, street-view imagery will be missing, so the developed solution should address the issue of missing modality.

My solution includes modeling two classification models: type I where training and inference are conducted on all modalities, type II where training is done on all modalities, but inference is conducted only on top-view imageries. The second model is inspired by the Shared-Specific Feature Modelling approach in [3](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/papers/Wang_Multi-Modal_Learning_With_Missing_Modality_via_Shared-Specific_Feature_Modelling_CVPR_2023_paper.pdf).
